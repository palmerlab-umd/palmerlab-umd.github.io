Dr. Palmer was awarded the 2018 Ruth Patrick Award by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography at the society's summer meeting. This award honors scientists who have applied the aquatic sciences towards solving critical environmental problems. Congratulations	 Margaret! 

During the meeting, Kelly and Alec both presented talks on their latest research:

* Kelly presented on _Seasonal patterns of methane concentrations and fluxes from Delmarva Bays in relation to hydrologic variability_
* Alec presented on _Using semi-continuous flourescence and absorption measurements during photoirradiation to characterize dissolved organic matter in a heterogeneous wetland landscape_.
