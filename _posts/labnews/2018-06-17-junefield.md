Summer fieldwork is well under way for the Palmer Lab! We are busy sampling gases, soils, wetland water, and setting up soil chambers, with the help of our fearless crew of summer undergraduate interns!

Our awesome lab interns are working on a variety of projects this summer (from left to right):

* Eshana is identifying plant species compositions in a few wetlands and helping set up soil gas sampling chambers.
* Bianca is sampling soils and quantifying fractions of carbon stabilization. 
* Julianna is analyzing restoration data and helping in the field.
* Maggie is sampling and analyzing wetland microbial communities.
* Abigail is running field-scale tracer experiments on wetland water residence time.

Stay tuned for more of their scientific exploits this summer!
