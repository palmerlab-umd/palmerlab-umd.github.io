### Funded M.S. or PhD student position available at the University of Maryland

*Position Summary:*

Drs. Margaret Palmer (Univ of Maryland) and Nate Jones (Univ Alabama) seek a student to join a dynamic team focused on understand the relationship between hydrology of wetland landscapes with carbon dynamics. While the fellow will have freedom to develop their own research questions, specific activities could include 1) over-seeing hydrologic field measurements across a gradient of headwater catchments; 2) characterization of wetland to catchment scale hydrology across the study catchments; and 3) use a combination of hydrologic measurements and hydrologic modeling to inform variation in measured DOM and CH4/CO2 fluxes.  The fellowâ€™s research will integrate the fields of hydrologic sciences, ecosystem ecology, and restoration science; and ultimately, help inform more effective wetland restoration and land management practices across the coastal plain region.  The student would matriculate through the University of Maryland, College Park.

Required Qualifications: 

* A B.S.  or M.S. in environmental science, civil/environmental engineering, or a closely related discipline. Some hydrologic field work experience. 

Preferred Qualifications: 

* Previous research or course work that may help link links hydrologic, biogeochemical, and ecological processes.  
* Relevant analytical skills: scripting languages (e.g., R, Python, and/or Matlab), geospatial analysis, and hydrologic modeling (e.g., HydroGeoSphere, MIKE-SHE, and/or MODFLOW)

**Interested individuals should send their C.V., transcript, and GRE scores to mpalmer@umd.edu and put "graduate positions" in the subject title along with your last name.**
