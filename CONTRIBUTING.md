Making updates to the Palmer Lab Website

People updates

To edit information about lab alums, edit `team/index.html`. There is a list starting around line 48 after the line `lab_alumni:`. Each line needs to begin with `- name: `. 

Enhancement: To automate link formatting, edit the layout instructions at the bottom of the page under ` {% for student in page.lab_alumni %}`
