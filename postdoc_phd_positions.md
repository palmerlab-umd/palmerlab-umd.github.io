# Join our lab!

If you are interested in applying to graduate school with the Palmer group and colleagues, first read a description of the current research and publications focusing on wetlands, stream networks, and carbon. If this is consistent with your interests, please send Dr. Palmer a statement of your particular research interests in this area, a resume, and unofficial copies of your transcripts and GRE scores. She will get back to after receiving all four pieces of information. Dr. Palmer accepts graduate students primarily through the [MEES](http://mees.umd.edu/) or [BEES](http://www.bisi.umd.edu/bees/) programs at the University of Maryland. Her graduate students are also involved to varying extents with activities at [SESYNC](https://sesync.org/).

## Internships

Undergraduate and recent graduate interns are an integral part of research with the Palmer Lab. If you have looked through our work and are interested in applying, please contact Dr. Palmer with a statement of your research interests, a resume, and an unofficial copy of your transcript.
