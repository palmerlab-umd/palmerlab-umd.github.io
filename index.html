        <h3>Natural, Restored and Agricultural wetlands on the Coastal Plain wetlands and their connections to stream networks</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Historically, the mid-Atlantic had vast expanses of low-lying forests with extensive freshwater wetlands and streams. 
		      Much of this land has been converted to farming over the last several hundred years. Ongoing pressures include continued farming and the growth of suburban developments. 
		      In recognition of the need for new approaches to systematically monitor and assess hydrologic conditions, wetland/stream ecosystem functions, and their impact on water quality, 
		      Palmer and colleagues have work on-going in the Eastern Shore of Maryland.</p>

	      <p>Our work focuses on GIWs on the Delmarva peninsula of the east coast U.S. where we are quantifying the patterns of connectivity of restored, natural, and agricultural wetlands to perennial stream networks. 
		      Among other differences, these three classes of wetlands vary in the duration and patterns of their connectivity as well as the amount and composition of dissolved organic matter flowing from them.
		      This research includes using remotely sensed data, particularly radar and lidar, and extensive field sampling and experimentation, to quantify a variety of ecological functions in depressional wetlands that connect to stream networks under certain hydrologic conditions.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p>Wetlands are among the most threatened ecosystems on earth yet they play extremely valuable roles in global elemental cycling. As transition points in the landscape between the terrestrial and aquatic realms, they are well known as sources of C production and biomass accumulation, as well as sinks of C received from the surrounding terrestrial environments.
		Despite their potential importance to understanding carbon fluxes they have not been adequately integrated into global scale terrestrial carbon budgets or into inland water carbon budgets.

	      and members of <a href="https://frec.vt.edu/people/McLaughlin.html/">Dr. Daniel McLaughlin’s</a> lab (hydrology, VT) 
	      to understand how wetland inundation and hydrologic connectivity influences carbon fluxes and stores.</p>
	      
	<p>The Coastal Plain field sites are on the Eastern Shore of Maryland where members of Palmer’s lab have worked for a number of years. 
	      Restored and natural wetlands in this predominantly agricultural region appear to be isolated during much of the year but work by past graduate students Owen McDonough, Jake Hosen, and Steve Epting have documented periods of extensive connectivity between wetlands and perennial streams via intermittent channels. 
	      Current work is expanding this to quantify the dynamic nature of wetland area above and below ground and how this influences the fluxes and lability of dissolved and gaseous organic carbon.
